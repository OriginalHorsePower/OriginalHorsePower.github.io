        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our little corner of the world is all about workin' with our two trusty horses to farm the land and get some timber the old-fashioned way. We call our wagon home, and it's drawn by our strong and steady horses. They ain't just our work partners, they're family. We all work together, and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
